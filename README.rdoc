= rush -- manage your unix systems with pure Ruby

rush is a unix integration library and an interactive shell which uses pure Ruby syntax.  Walk directory trees; create, copy, search, and destroy files; find and kill processes - everything you'd normally do with shell commands, now in the strict and elegant world of Ruby.

== Install

  gem install rush3


Or for the bleeding edge:

  git clone git://github.com/protolif/rush.git
  cd rush
  gem build *.gemspec
  gem install *.gem


If you want the development version, you will need the development headers for ruby (eg. ruby-dev in most package managers) and change that last command to:

  git clone git://github.com/protolif/rush.git
  cd rush
  bundle install     # to get the dependencies
  rake spec          # to run the tests
  rake rdoc          # to generate a local copy of the docs from your sourcetree (optional)

  rake install  # install your default gem location


To uninstall

  gem uninstall rush3


== Usage

Count the number of classes in your project using bash:

  find myproj -name \*.rb | xargs grep '^\s*class' | wc -l

In rush, this is:

  myproj['**/*.rb'].search(/^\s*class/).lines.size

Pesky stray mongrels?  In bash:

  kill `ps aux | grep mongrel_rails | grep -v grep | cut -c 10-20`

In rush:

  processes.filter(:cmdline => /mongrel_rails/).kill

== As a library

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rush'

  file = Rush['/tmp/myfile']
  file.write "hello"
  puts file.contents
  file.destroy

  puts Rush.my_process.pid
  puts Rush.processes.size
  puts Rush.bash("echo SHELL COMMAND | tr A-Z a-z")
  puts Rush.launch_dir['*.rb'].search(/Rush/).entries.inspect

== Invoking the shell

Run the "rush" binary to enter the interactive shell.

== Remote access and clustering

rush can control any number of remote machines from a single location. Copy files or directories between servers as seamlessly as if it was all local.

Example of remote access:

  local = Rush::Box.new('localhost')
  remote = Rush::Box.new('my.remote.server.com')
  local_dir = local['/Users/adam/myproj/']
  remote_dir = remote['/home/myproj/app/']

  local_dir.copy_to remote_dir
  remote_dir['**/.svn/'].each { |d| d.destroy }

Clustering:

  local_dir = Rush::Box.new('localhost')['/Users/adam/server_logs/'].create
  servers = %w(www1 www2 www3).map { |n| Rush::Box.new(n) }
  servers.each { |s| s['/var/log/nginx/access.log'].copy_to local_dir["#{s.host}_access.log"] }
